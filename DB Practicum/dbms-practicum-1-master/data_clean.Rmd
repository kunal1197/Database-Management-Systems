```{r}
df <- read.csv('BirdStrikesData.csv', check.names = FALSE)
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
```

129 rows do not have any data for most of the columns, so dropping these.
Checking with a single column - "Aircraft: Type" will suffice as all the other
fields are null too for the same. We will now work with this cleaned data frame.
```{r}
df_cleaned <- df[df$`Aircraft: Type` != "", ]
nrow(df_cleaned)
ncol(df_cleaned)
```

Replace origin state with "International" where the Origin State is null,
as this can happen only in cases of international flights.
```{r}
df_cleaned$`Origin State`[df_cleaned$`Origin State` == "N/A"] <- "International"
df_cleaned
```

```{r}
write.csv(df_cleaned, "BirdStrikesDataCleaned.csv", row.names = F)
```
